Description: IRT-based data simulation and analysis methods for multivariate endpoints 
    (items) in trials of progressive supranuclear palsy. Efficiency of 
    analysis tests is evaluated through the comparison of simulated power. The corresponding 
    type I error rates are estimated as well.
